My name is Alex. I am a software engineer that works on the web. I currently work at [iStreamplanet](https://istreamplanet.com/) building APIs using [Golang](https://golang.org/). In previous roles I have built single page applications (SPAs) using [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/).

I am passionate about data visualization, web privacy/security, artifical intelligence, and decentralized governance (i.e. blockchain). I value clear and concise communication which is a skill I plan to hone by writing content for this site.

My non-technical interests include travel, reading, photography, cooking and personal fitness.
