Hi I'm Alex. I build scalable backend systems and APIs that power modern web applications. I currently work at [SailPoint](https://www.sailpoint.com/) as a software engineer, developing identity governance solutions using [Java](https://openjdk.org/) and [Golang](https://golang.org/). 

Previously, I built high-performance APIs at [Persefoni](https://persefoni.com/) using Go, and developed microservices architecture at [iStreamplanet](https://istreamplanet.com/). Earlier in my career, I created single-page applications with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/).

I'm passionate about distributed systems, data visualization, web security, artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies like blockchain. Beyond code, I enjoy travel, reading, photography, cooking, and staying fit.

I value clear communication and plan to share insights about technology and software development through this site.
